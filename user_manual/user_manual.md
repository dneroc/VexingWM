## 3. Launching the Window Manager

The first thing you will notice when you launch the window is a blank screen. Don’t worry, the program is not broken. This is the initial state of the program. From here you can execute key and mouse commands to launch and manipulate windows. Most commands use the use of a modifier key, which in our program is the Alt key, andanother key or mouse click at the same time. Additionally there are some commands which only require the mouse.

## 4. Window Manager Functions

**4.1 Move a window**
Window managers allow you to move a position all of the windows displayed on the screen.
This is to allow the user to place window where they prefer them to be. If you would like to
reposition a window open on the screen there are several ways to do it:

● Move the mouse cursor over the title bar (blue). Holding the left mouse key, drag the
mouse across the screen and release the button when you are satisfied where you
have placed the window.

● Ensure that the window is in focus by left clicking it. Hold down the Alt key and press
the following keys to move the window:

○ Pressing the left key moves and resizes the window to the left half of the
screen.

○ Pressing the right key moves and resizes the window to the right half of the
screen.

○ Pressing the up key moves and resizes the window to fill the whole screen.

**4.2 Resize a window**
The function of resizing is very important in window managers as it allows the user to
enlarge windows for a clearer view or to make them smaller to make more space for other
windows. If you would like to resize the window to make it smaller or bigger you can do one
of the following:

maximise button). Hold the Alt key and press and hold the right mouse button. Move
the mouse until you reach a desired size and release the Alt key and the right mouse

screen.

○ Pressing the up key moves and resizes the window to fill the whole screen.


**4.3 Open a new program**
If you are unable to open a program in your window manager it means that you aren’t able to
do anything. Since a window managers purpose is to handle windows it’s very important for
you to know how to launch a new program. If you would like to launch a new program you
can do it in one of the following ways:

● Hold down Alt and press the Return key. This will launch a new terminal window. You
can enter the desired program and launch it from the terminal.

then type in the program of your choice and press return to launch it.

**4.4 Close an open window**
You might want to close open windows in cases such as your no longer using the program
or there are too many on the screen. If you would like to close a program you can do it in
one of the following ways:

● Move the mouse cursor to the red exit button on the top left of the window of your
choice. Press this with the left mouse button. This will close the open window.

● Ensure a window is in focus by left clicking anywhere within the frame(excluding the
exit or maximise button). Hold Alt and press the F4 key to close the focused window.

**4.5 Switch and focus to a window**
Switching window allows you to type and interact with the application opened. With the focus
set it also specifies which window becomes affected by the keyboard shortcuts. If you would
like to switch and focus to a certain window or program you can do it in one of the following
ways:

the exit button or the maximise button. This will bring the window to the top and focus
