Starting Off
===

Went Well:  
Got a good amount of work done  
Didnâ€™t get too distracted  
Have a better understanding of the x system and how it applies to window managers  
Got a lot of resources and options to check out  

Went bad:  
Didnâ€™t put in enough effort to come in earlier, started quite late and got tired quicker than if we had started earlier  

What to change for tomorrow:  
Come in on time or no more than an hour late  

Blog:  
First thing we did was go over several different Window Managers written in Python such as tinywm, simplewm, pointlesswm, wimsy. Also had a look at the Python X Library and the X Window Manager Manual. We didnâ€™t do any actual coding but got a lot of research and understanding of what's involved compared to this afternoon. Read a lot of the python library documentation and figured out what a normal event loop should look like and how windows look for events.
