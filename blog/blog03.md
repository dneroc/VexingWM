# 22 Jan 2018: Not Sure what to name this one

Went well:  
Came early enough  
Started on work and didn't get too distracted  
Xephyr  
Finally installed linux  
Set up blog other misc things  

Went bad:  
Troubleshooting took forever  
Couldn't get an example running, launch python, making it executable  

What to change for tomorrow:  
More interaction find out what we are doing  
Figure out how to get python running  
Reading the source code and finding out what it does  

Blog:  
Today we came in and began discussions on what we are going to accomplish. We have installed Xephyr (a nested X server) and will be using it as a testing ground for our Window Manager as we are able to display it and load separate Window Managers onto it. It took a lot of trial and error to install the Linux system on Ben's laptop, at one point the whole system went black which I realise as of now was because I had managed to install a window manager on to the laptop.  
Currently our main goals are to get a basic version running and begin study on how the window managers work and behave.
