# Making Our Own Window manager 

Over the next couple of weeks we did a **lot** of research on how the Xlibraries worked and how other developers implimented them in programs. From our research we made a basic program that could execute a small number of basic commands. This was a big leap from theorizing to doing and symbolised a knowledge gap that previously existed, and a milestone in creating the rest of our program.
