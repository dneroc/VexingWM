# 24 Jan 2018: Configuring Testing Environment 

Went well:  
Fixed Linux  
Launched example program in testing environment  
Launched sample program in a real life environment  
Xinit  

Went bad:  
Got distracted and only worked for a small period of time  

What to change for tomorrow:  
Be more aware of when we get distracted  
Get better at getting back to work   
Work on coming in on time.  

Blog:  
Came in at 12.30. Ben worked on fixing his Linux installation while David worked on launching a Python window manager in Xephyr, then an actual Linux Display using xinit. Found a good example to work off and familiarised with how the program is going to be launched.
