The past couple of days have been filled with challanges and bugs tht we are slowly overcoming. One major error that was occuring was a bug that kept crashing the program. It turn out that it was due to not having breaks in the event loop switch. I had taken them outeralier and forgot which cuaed a few hour of lost work. Another big issue was selecting the right title bar and making it move. I implemented a simple logger using cout to see where exactly the problem was. The title bar attribute was not reseting between button clicks which caused the program to only regiter the first title bar clicked. We are making steady progress with no challange being impossible by solving the bugs in a methodic and intuitive way. Currently trying to implement the proper destruction of windows, correct resizing, window switching with alt-tab and creating unit and automated tests. I also feel like implementing title bar buttons such as the close program button will not be too difficult to implement. Slowly but surely.
