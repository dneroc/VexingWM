Add in a wallpaper when opened, check previous code(Maybe not the best idea as an outside program is needed, but maybe can be done with a window wallpaper with an image, I dunno?) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6609281/how-to-draw-an-image-from-file-on-window-with-xlib

Error handling if another window manager exists

Click focus to window with focus grab(Maybe change border colour to show this)

Click anywhere to bring window to top

Have a look at the functional specifications for ideas etc.

Title bar buttons - minimise, fullscreen

Create tests

Check if all windows have been reframed

Clicking anywhere to raise window needs an event from frame and then a correct keypress procedure

Focused window becomes highlighted

Right click on display to bring up a menu

BUGS
=========================================

Calling chromium-browser does not reparent properly, title bar parents in the middle of it. Maybe reparenting too early

Alt - tab for switching windows should not work for the title bar button, change what the xterm buttons parent is. 
Actually all windows on the root display get switched, need to figure out a way to differenciate the windows and the menu, maybe set all other windows within another frame but possibly not

If program is called with xterm, cannot type in xterm anymore

Sometimes xeyes doesn't frame on start up
