Add in a wallpaper when opened, check previous code(Maybe not the best idea as an outside program is needed, but maybe can be done with a window wallpaper with an image, I dunno?) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6609281/how-to-draw-an-image-from-file-on-window-with-xlib

Error handling if another window manager exists

Click focus to window with focus grab(Maybe change border colour to show this)

Click anywhere to bring window to top

Have a look at the functional specifications for ideas etc.

Title bar buttons - minimise, fullscreen

Create tests

Check if all windows have been reframed

BUGS
=========================================

Calling chromium-browser does not reparent properly, title bar parents in the middle of it. Maybe reparenting too early

Gedit does not reparent properly either
